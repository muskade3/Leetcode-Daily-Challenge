Ques-->
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

Code-->
class Solution {
    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
       
        Arrays.sort(g);
        Arrays.sort(s);
        int j =0;
for(int i=0;i<s.length&&j<g.length;i++)
{
    if(s[i]>=g[j])
        {
j++;

    }
}
return j;
    }
}
